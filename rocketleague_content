      "This is especially true while your cruising through the lower tiers of the game, from Bronze to the early part of Gold, most players rely on power more than finesse so dont be scared to use your shadow defence skills, lay back and wait for the opportunity to get a good open shot at the net"

      "flip to block",
      "https://img.youtube.com/vi/DacI5daoH_k/maxresdefault.jpg",
      "Different to the main game, Rocket League Sideswipe does not put a time limit for your flip, which is a great strategic advantage as it was one of the most stressful things to think about when you are in the middle of an aerial. Here you can fly through the whole field, come back and still use your flip to block a shot which is great"

      "I mean, we understand that flexing on your opponents can be part of a players personality, but it is still just a game and everything should be left on the field, even the rivalry. There is no need for a Nice shot after an open-net miss or a What a save after a keeper whiffs, the game is just way more fun when we keep a competitive yet friendly environment at all times"

      "Ultimately it is always refreshing when a great game gets a mobile adaptation and so far things seem to be on track to keep building a fan base of its own so you should definitely give it an opportunity as well"
